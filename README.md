Samples taken from the Oboe library: https://github.com/google/oboe/tree/main/samples.
Restructured each sample to be independent of the main library code and dependent utility libraries.

DrumPad - plays audio from static WAV files when a custom view component is touched [DrumThumper]  
InoutLoop - takes audio from the input stream and writes it to the output stream [LiveEffect]  
MultiSynth - multi oscillator synth [MegaDrone]  
PlayStarter - creates an audio stream and plays white noise [MinimalOboe]  
SinePlayer - plays a sine wave and allows to adjust output stream parameters [HelloOboe]  
RhythmGame - plays static mp3 files after decoding them to raw samples using ffmpeg compiled library, checks if taps match the claps of the music played in background  
SynthPad - pads with assigned notes playing a synthersized sound [SoundBoard]
